title: Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja
---

 After working with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for more than 5 years, I needed a refresher on JavaScript. So I picked up John Resig's Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja. Yes, the same person who gave us [JQuery](https://jquery.com/).

So far, the book hasn't disappointed me. It covers all the good parts of JavaScript, including functions, closures, object, and DOM manipulation. Highly recommended.
