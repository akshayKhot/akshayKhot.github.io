title: Brian Kernighan on Open Office Plan
---

In his book, Unix: A History and a Memoir, Brian Kernighan talks about the Unix room at Bell Labs where the operating system was developed, and contrasts it with the modern open offices. 

> In retrospect, I think that Bell Labs did a good job with space. Private offices, though they cost more than open areas, give people peace and quiet, a place to focus without constant noise in the background, storage for books and papers, and a door to close for intense thought or private conversations. 



> By now, I've spent enough time in open-plan work areas to know that, for me at least, they are utterly destructive of concentration. The Bell Labs mixture of oneâ€™s own private office and a shared space for the community worked very well.
