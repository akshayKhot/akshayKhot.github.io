I went to a study-abroad seminar hosted by GeeBee this morning. They did an excellent job of explaining the process to pursue higher education abroad. 

I have decided to pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Canada.

The process seems to be long, with many steps; but I am sure it will be worth it. 

1. I have to learn English and give IELTS, 
2. Apply to Canadian universities, 
3. Get admitted, 
4. Apply for study permit, 
5. Arrange housing and much more. 

Luckily, I don’t have any other obligations right now, and have all the free time in the world to focus on this. Though I said earlier that I don’t want to be a software engineer, maybe I will give this another try. Maybe it will work out, this time.

Like all major decisions so far, I haven’t told this to my parents yet. They are away travelling, and I plan to surprise them when they are back.
