title: I Have a New Email
tags: news personal

I have finally made a switch to [Hey](https://hey.com) for email. From now on, you can send me an email to `akshay.khot@hey.com`.

<div class="random centered">
  <a target="_blank" href="{{site.images}}/hey.jpg">
    <img src="{{site.images}}/hey.jpg" alt="Hey Email">
  </a>
  <div class="caption">Hey</div>
</div>

Here are three reasons am paying $99 USD per year for email. 

- I don't want to store my personal emails on Google's servers anymore.

- I don't want my data and personal information to be exploited by the big silicon valley tech companies for ad revenue. 

- I want to use a great product, developed by [people](https://dhh.dk/) I [respect](https://world.hey.com/jason) and a [company](https://basecamp.com) I admire. 

So there you go. Email me at `akshay.khot@hey.com`. I really look forward to hearing back from you.
