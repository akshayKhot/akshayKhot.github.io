Why do we want to go to Mars? It sucks. Here's [a letter from the Earth](https://www.marssucks.com/) to all the humans who want to go to Mars. 

Mars sucks.

Its weather sucks. Its distance sucks. Its atmosphere sucks. The little water it has, sucks.

It has sucked for billions of years. And will suck for billions more.

You know what doesn’t suck? Me, Earth.

I have life. I have vast oceans and lush forests. I have rivers to swim. Air to breathe.

But the way I’m being treated, that part sucks.

You use me and pollute me. You overheat me. You use every resource I have and return very little back from where it came.

And then, you dream of Mars. A hellhole. A barren, desolate, wasteland you can’t set foot on fast enough. 

Why not use some of that creative energy and billions on saving me? You know, the planet that’s giving you what you need to live right now.

Mars can wait. I can’t.

&ndash; Earth
