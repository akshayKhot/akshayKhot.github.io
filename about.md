My name is Akshay, and I am a software developer based in Victoria, British Columbia. I've been programming for the past decade, and I strive to write software that solves real problems.

Currently I'm working as a software developer at CityView, a municipal software company, and one of the best companies in Victoria. We build web/mobile/desktop applications for our customers, who are the municipalities and townships all over Canada and USA. I have been at CityView for three years and it's been a fantastic journey so far. 

Before CityView, I did my Master's in Computer Science from the University of Victoria, where I designed & implemented a scalable algorithm to find the most influential users in a network. A short paper based on my thesis was published in EDBT Vienna 2018 (Microsoft Research). You can find a copy of my thesis [here](https://dspace.library.uvic.ca//handle/1828/8885).

I am married to Pratiksha, who loves to draw. You might see her [drawings](/drawings) frequently on the blog.  

I love reading. Mostly non-fiction. Occasionally, I will post a summary of the books I read and found interesting on this blog.
