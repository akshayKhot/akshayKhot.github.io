My name is Akshay, and I am a software developer based in Victoria, British Columbia. I've been programming for the past decade, striving to write quality software that solves real problems.  

I work for CityView, a municipal software company that is also one of Victoria's best software companies. We build web/mobile/desktop applications for our customers, who are the municipalities and townships all over Canada and the USA. I have been at CityView for three years, and it's been a fantastic journey so far. Currently, I am working remotely from India since October 2020.

Before CityView, I did my Master's in Computer Science from the University of Victoria. My work involved designing & implementing a scalable algorithm to find the most influential users in a network. I published a short paper based on my thesis in EDBT Vienna 2018 (Microsoft Research). You can find a copy of my thesis [here](https://dspace.library.uvic.ca//handle/1828/8885).   

I love [reading](/books). Mostly non-fiction. Occasionally, I post a summary of the books I read and found interesting on this blog. You can find my reading list for [2018](/blog/books-I-read-in-2018), [2019](/blog/books-I-read-in-2019), and [2020](/blog/books-I-read-in-2020). Here is the list of books I am reading in [2021](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/eyqQGbQ2ZqMEWRrmw6x19XGN). 

To get in touch, you can send me an email (see below).

Thanks for stopping by.
