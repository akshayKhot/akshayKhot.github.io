After a full night of sleep, the prefrontal cortex - the rational brain - is fully connected to the amygdala - the emotional brain. 

The best bridge between despair and hope is a good night's sleep.

During sleep, the brain cleans itself using the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain. When we wake up in the morning, our brains can once again function efficiently thanks to this deep cleansing. 

Sleep fights against infection and sickness by strengthening the immune system and also increases Testosterone.
