title: Charlie Munger's Daily Journal Notes
---

Here are the notes I took from Charlie Munger from the Daily Journal annual meeting. 

**On recent GameStop frenzy**

> It's really stupid to have a culture which encourages gambling in stocks by people who have mindset of race-track betters. I have a very simple idea on this subject. I think you should try to make your money in this world by selling other people things that are good for them. And if you are selling gambling services where you take profits off the top, like RobinHood, I think it's a dirty way to make money, and we are crazy to allow it.
