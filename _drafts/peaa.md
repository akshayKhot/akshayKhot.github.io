title: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture
---

This is a book on enterprise application design. Enterprise applications are about the display, manipulation, and storage of large amounts of often complex data and the support or automation of business processes with that data. Examples include reservation systems, financial systems, supply chain systems, and many others that run modern business. 

The primary topics the book explores are

- Layering of enterprise applications
- Structuring domain (business) logic
- Structuring a Web user interface
- Linking in-memory modules (particularly objects) to a relational database
- Handling session state in stateless environments
- Principles of distribution

> Choosing an architecture means that you have to understand the particular problems of your system and choose an appropriate design based on that understanding.
