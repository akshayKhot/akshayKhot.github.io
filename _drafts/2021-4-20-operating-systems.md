title: Principles of Computer System Design
---

The book provides a broad and in-depth introduction to the main principles and abstractions for engineering computer systems, be it an operating system, a client/server application, a database system, a securre web site, or a fault-tolerant disk cluster. 

It documents the essence of client/server computing, remote procedure calls, files, threads, address spaces, best-effort networks, atomicity, authenticated messages, and so on. Fundamental ideas include design principles, modularity, naming, abstraction, concurrency, communications, fault tolerance, and atomicity. 

It identifies and develops concepts and design principles that are common to several specialty fields: software engineering, programming languages, operating systems, distributed systems, networking, database systems, and machine architecture.

### Elements of Computer System Organization

Introduces three key methods of achieving and taking advantage of modularity in computer systems: abstraction, naming, and layers. 

---

### Design of Naming Schemes

---

### Enforcing Modularity with Clients and Services

Introduces the powerful and widely used method of allowing modules to interact without interfering with one another. 

---

### Enforcing Modularity with Virtualization

Introduces the virtual memory and threads. 

---

### Performance

Focuses on intrinsic performance bottlenecks that are found in common across many kinds of computer systems, including operating systems, databases, networks, and large applications.
