The basic purpose of advertising is to make people buy a product or a service.

Poor copy cannot overcome faults or gaps in dealer distribution; it cannot even cash in on the finest dealer setups. But good copy can, and does, surmount many dealer difficulties, making them secondary, and selling in spite of them.

**There are three things that advertising can tell its readers:** 

1. What the product is
2. What it does; and most importantly
3. What it can accomplish for you. That is, show people an advantage. What other people will say of you, think of you, do for you—how they will admire you, envy you, imitate you—because of what my product can accomplish for you.


**Fundamentals of a good advertisement**

- Get Attention
- Show People an Advantage
- Prove It
- Persuade People to Grasp This Advantage
- Ask for Action

### Get Attention

**Headlines**

The headline of an advertisement is like a flag being held up by a flagman alongside a railroad track. He is using it to try to get the immediate attention of the engineer of an approaching train—so that he can give him some kind of message.

The headline must capture attention. It must offer a "reward for reading", which must be sufficiently attractive to induce the reader to continue reading beyond the headline.

A good headline selects a few readers out of the many who are (or can be) interested in the subject, and it promises them a worthwhile reward for reading it.

One of the principal objectives of a headline is to strike as directly as possible right at a situation confronting the reader.

**What kind of rewards should a headline provide?** 

- How the reader can save, gain, or accomplish something that will increase his satisfaction? For example **The secret of making people like you**
- How the reader can avoid, reduce, or eliminate risks, worries, losses, mistakes? Eliminating the risk of loss is even more attractive to the reader than the prospect of gain. For example,
  - A little mistake that cost a farmer $3000 a year
  - Do you make **these** mistakes in English?

**What are some characteristics of a good headline?**

- They ask a question to which people want to read the answer. 
- They generate curiosity in the content which follows. 

**Examples of good headlines that work**

1. The secret of making __ like you
2. A little mistake that cost a __ $_ a year
3. Advice to __ who don't __ 
5. Are you ever __ at a __?
7. How to win friends and influence people
8. The last 2 hours are the longest - and those are the 2 hours you save
9. Who else wants a __?
10. Do you make these mistakes in __?
15. When (expert)__ feel __, this is what they do
16. Five common (problems) __
17. How I improved my __ in one evening
19. Whose fault when __ __?
20. How a __ made me a __?
21. Have you these symptoms of __ ?
22. Do you do any of these embarrassing things?
23. Six type of __ -- which group are you in?
24. How to solve __
25. Does Your _ Ever _?
26. To People Who Want To _ - But Can't Get Started
27. Throw Away Your _!
28. Little Things That Keep Your Code
29. How To Plan Your _ 
30. What Every _ Should Know About _

**Some Guidelines**

1. Use pictures in your writing
2. Show product in use: doing something, accomplishing something for the reader
3. Write the copy first and then make the layout. The selling message is the first consideration, not the technique of presenting it. Your preoccupation should be with the substance, not with the form.

### Show People an Advantage

Capturing attention and holding it are two different things.

The thing people want to know above everything else is: **What will it do for me?**

> “Nothing of yours ever seems half so important to me (the consumer) as it does to you. Millions of advertising dollars are wasted every year because what I want to hear has nothing to do with what you want to say.”

Show people—in words, or pictures, or both—what they can save, gain, or accomplish with your product...how it will increase this: their mental, physical, financial, social, emotional, or spiritual stimulation, satisfaction, self-respect, well-being, or security. And here is the minus generalization.

Show people—in words, or pictures, or both—what risks, worries, losses, mistakes, embarrassments, doubts, drudgery, or other undesirable conditions your product will help them to avoid, lessen, or eliminate...how it will decrease this: their fear of poverty, illness or accident, discomfort, boredom, offense to others, and the loss of business, personal, or social prestige or advancement.

If you will tie up the advantages of your product with what people want to gain, be, do, and save, you will make them want to buy.

> The arresting power of an advertisement is the ability of the main illustration, the headline and the layout—as a composite unit—to force a reading of the first paragraph by those who are your prospects.

**Importance of your first paragraph**

The first paragraph is a critical determinant of whether your intended reader will get to reading your copy. The reader will not go far along with you unless the first paragraph holds the attention and interest which your headline and layout have aroused. It is also usually the most difficult to write. It should:

1. Follow through with the idea or appeal expressed in the main headline - wihch attracted the reader in the first place. 
2. Be short, with quick, easy-to-read sentencesl entice the reader to stay with you into the paragraphs which follow.
3. Perhaps start with a question, one so pertinent or challenging as to grip the reader's interest at once and encourage them to keep reading to find the answer. 
4. Show the reward-for-reading promise you made in your headline. Compress a few of the major advantages of your product. Show the reader what you are selling will do for them.
