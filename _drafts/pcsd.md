title: Principles of Computer System Design
---

The book provides a broad and in-depth introduction to the main principles and abstractions for engineering computer systems, be it an operating system, a client/server application, a database system, a securre web site, or a fault-tolerant disk cluster. 

It documents the essence of client/server computing, remote procedure calls, files, threads, address spaces, best-effort networks, atomicity, authenticated messages, and so on. Fundamental ideas include design principles, modularity, naming, abstraction, concurrency, communications, fault tolerance, and atomicity. 

It identifies and develops concepts and design principles that are common to several specialty fields: software engineering, programming languages, operating systems, distributed systems, networking, database systems, and machine architecture.

### Elements of Computer System Organization

Introduces three key methods of achieving and taking advantage of modularity in computer systems: abstraction, naming, and layers. It reviews the architecture and organization of computer systems in the light fo abstraction, naming, and layering. 

[**The Three Fundamental Abstractions**](/abstractions-in-computing)

Introduces the three fundamental abstractions.

1. Memory
2. Interpreter
3. Communication Links

**Naming in Computer Systems**

Presents a model for naming and explains how names are used in computer systems.

**Using Layers**

Discusses how a designer combines the abstractions using names and layers. 

**Case study involving a real file system**

### Enforcing Modularity with Clients and Services

Introduces the powerful and widely used method of allowing modules to interact without interfering with one another. 

---

### Enforcing Modularity with Virtualization

Introduces the virtual memory and threads. 

---

### Performance

Focuses on intrinsic performance bottlenecks that are found in common across many kinds of computer systems, including operating systems, databases, networks, and large applications.
