title: What's Wrong With Enterprise Software 
---

One of the strangest things about enterprise software to me has always been how damn far everyone is from the products they create and the customers who use them. 

I think way too many companies and teams try to overachieve by building a ton of software, by building tons of flexibility into their software, including tons of features and by imagining all the things that somebody out there might need in some way, some day. I think that's a really hard way to develop software because it's so much fumbling in the dark.

There's so much software out there that's just endlessly complex, that has too many features, that has too much flexibility, and it ends up not being used because users can't relate to it; they can't get into it. It feels too complex. It feels intimidating when what they really need is just a small subset of what they're given.

Nobody would say, "I want to make complex software." But they do say things that amount to the same thing. "I want my software to have tons of features. I want my software to have endless flexibility." Well, all these things are in essence saying, "I want complex software." We're willing to take a stand for simplicity in software. We're willing to say, "You aren't going to get all the features you think you might need some day, you're just going to have the basics executed beautifully. You're not going to get all the flexibility you might imagine that you could need, but we'll give you some." We're going to have opinions and we're going to instill defaults and we're going to package it up.
