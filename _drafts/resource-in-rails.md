Roy Fielding created the Representational State Transfer protocol as the topic of his thesis. He is also one of the authors of the HTTP protocol. REST is a series of constraints upon the interactions between the system components. The big ideas in REST include the client-server architecture, stateless communication, HTTP request methods such as GET, POST, etc.
