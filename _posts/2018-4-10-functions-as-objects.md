title: Functions as Objects
---

In JavaScript, functions are objects. We can not only call them, but pass them to other functions and also receive them from other functions. 

What's cool, is that we can instantiate new functions by using the **new** syntax. 

```
let func = new Function ([arg1, arg2, ...argN], body);
```

The function **func** is created with the arguments as the first parameter, and the body as the second parameter. 

```
let log = new Function('val', 'console.log(val)');
log('test'); // prints 'test'
```

We can also create a function that doesn't take any parameters, 

```
let say = new Function(`console.log('saying')`);
say();  // prints 'saying'
```

Like objects, functions do have a few properties, including:

**name**

Returns the name of the function, or an empty string

```
function log(val) {
    console.log(val);
}

log(log.name); // logs 'log'. Is your head spinning, too?
```

**length** 

Returns the number of function parameters, rest parameters are not counted. 

```
function log(val) {
    console.log(val);
}

log(log.length); // logs 1
```
