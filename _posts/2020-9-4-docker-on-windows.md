Windows containers don't have the same licensing requirements as servers or virtual machines running Windows. Windows is licensed at the host level, not the container level. If you have 100 Windows containers running on one server, you only need one license for the server. 

What that means is, if your company currently uses virtual machines to isolate application workloads, you can save so much money by moving to containers. Removing the VM layer and running apps in containers directly on the server removes the licensing requirement for all virtual machines, as well as the management overhead for all those machines.
