title: Bugs = Mistakes

Ever since Ad. Grace Murray Hopper found the first computer bug in the Mark ll computer's logbook; programmers referred to any abnormal software behaviour as a bug.

As long as we call our mistakes bugs, it may give us the comforting feeling that these bugs just crawled spontaneously into our programs. However, that only means we take no responsibility whatsoever for our mistakes that caused these bugs. 

It's time we stop sugar-coating our mistakes by calling them bugs and call them by what they are. Just mistakes.
