title: Remembering Gerald Weinberg
---

Gerald Weinberg is one of the programmers who has influenced so much of my thinking as a programmer. He passed away on August 7, 2018, at the age of 84. He had simple, but very profound, Zen-like insights on everything related to software development, programming, and many other disciplines. He has left the software industry with a better understanding of what it means to be a programmer.
