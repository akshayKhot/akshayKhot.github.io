title: Work From Anywhere
---

The trend catches on. On Friday, Spotify [announced](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6767071085453283328/) their "Work From Anywhere" program, which lets employees work from anywhere in the world, while still paying San Francisco and New York salaries.

Highlights from the announcement:

- Work isn’t something our people come to the office for, it’s something they do.
- Effectiveness can’t be measured by the number of hours people spend in an office.
- Giving people the freedom to choose where they work from improves their effectiveness.
- A distributed-first structure challenges us to improve our communication and collaboration practices, processes, and tools.
