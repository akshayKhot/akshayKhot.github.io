You want your code to be reviewed by a repairman, instead of an inspector. 

A repairman looks for flaws with **the intent of fixing them and avoiding them in the future**. An inspector, on the other hand, only points them out. This results in shame and avoidance. 

Much better to have a repairman looking at your code.
