My head hurts. Itâ€™s 11 pm at night, and I just finished a 3 hour debugging marathon to fix a bug that has been on my to-do for last 2 weeks. What began as a simple list of items not showing up in the browser ended up in an ill-formatted sql caused by mis-match of enumeration in a switch statement in the deep backend. The fix involved changing a single word, but the path I had to take was treacherous and equally fulfilling. The feeling is serene.
