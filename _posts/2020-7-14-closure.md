A lambda expression can reference the local variables of the method in which it is defined. 

```c#
void DoStuff() 
{
  int factor = 2;
  Func<int, int> multiplier = x => x * factor;
}
```

In the above example, the outer variable **factor** is captured by the lambda **multiplier**.

**A lambda expression that captures variables is called a closure.**

An interesting fact about the closures is that the captured variables are evaluated when the delegate is actually invoked, not when the variables are captured.

For example, this code prints **333** to the console instead of **012.**

```c#
Action[] actions = new Action[3];

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    actions[i] = () => Console.WriteLine(i);
}

foreach (var action in actions)
{
    action();
}
```

Every time we create the new **Action** in the first for loop, it captures the same variable `i`.

However, it's only evaluated when we actually invoke each action delegate. At that point, the value of the `i` is 3, as that was the final value that forced the control out of the loop. Hence it prints 3 three times.  

The above code can be re-written as follows for a better understanding. 

```c#
Action[] actions = new Action[3];

int i = 0;
actions[0] = () => Console.Write(i);

i = 1;
actions[1] = () => Console.Write(i);

i = 2;
actions[2] = () => Console.Write(i);

i = 3;
foreach (var action in actions)
{
    action(); // 333
}
```

If we want the closure to print each value of `i`, we need to store it in a temporary variable. This variable will get created every time the loop runs, which forces the closure to capture the latest value of the `i`. 

```c#
Action[] actions = new Action[3];

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    int scoped = i;
    actions[i] = () => Console.WriteLine(scoped);
}

foreach (var action in actions)
{
    action();
}
```
