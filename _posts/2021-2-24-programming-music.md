What music do you listen to while programming?

For the last few weeks, I have been programming while listening to the Harry Potter theme. It has done wonders for my productivity.

As soon as it starts, it takes me to the magical world of Hogwarts. All the distractions and background noise just melt away. It's much easier to get into the magical [flow](https://zenhabits.net/guide-to-achieving-flow-and-happiness-in-your-work/) state. I lose track of time and hours seem to fly by. 

I am able to maintain my focus and concentration over a much longer period.
