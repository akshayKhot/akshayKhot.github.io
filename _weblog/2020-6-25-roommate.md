I am looking for a roommate to share my one bedroom apartment on Quadra-Mckenzie. It's a semi-private room, most suitable for students who are looking for temporary stay.

About the apartment:
\- Fully furnished.
\- Coin operated laundry in the building.
\- Thrifty Foods, Tim Hortons, Starbucks within a walking distance
\- Convenient access to UVic (26, 16), Downtown (6), and Uptown (26, 16).
\- Galloping Goose trail and Swan lake within a walking distance
\- There is no lease.

I have a car, and can share rides to Walmart for grocery shopping etc., if needed. I don't smoke/drink, and absolutely no smoking/alcohol in the apartment.

If you are in Victoria and looking for a place, drop me an email.
