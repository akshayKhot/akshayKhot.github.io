Don't you just love when your entire sign-up workflow is done in minutes, and your bank transactions involving money are done in seconds, but a simple 'unsubscribe' from the marketing emails **may take up to 10 business days** to take effect?

Come on, Tangerine, you are on online bank, just remove my email from your marketing email list, it shouldn't take up to 10 business days!!!

For what it's worth, I love banking using Tangerine, it's just these shoddy marketing strategies employed by so many online websites that annoy me so much.
